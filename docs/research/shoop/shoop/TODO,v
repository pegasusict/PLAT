@* Here is an optimization to consider.  Keep a cache of recently called
  methods (by object), and what was finally called. Invalidate when any
  parent is changed, or any new method added.  Add to the cache whenever
  a second level resolve is done to call a method.
  DONE (investigate ways to only paritially blow away a cache, instead of
	blowing away the whole thing anytime something changes).
	DONE
  * Severity: critical
    Add a way to clear the cache when an object is created/destroyed.
    DONE, but it blows away the whole cache.  This is sub-obtimal.  Lazy
	resolving makes this not simple to fix.


* Regression test suite.
  DONE
* protected/private methods/variables.
  DONE

* A module that implements hashes.
* Command-line option parsing module.
