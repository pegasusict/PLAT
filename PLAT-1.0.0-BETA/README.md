# PLAT
Pegasus' Linux Administration Tools is a set of bash scripts that make life easier for the lazy/newbie user on Ubuntu
PLAT is a suite of scripts which help with tedious repetitive tasks which make up a large portion of Linux administration.
Currently there's a Post Install script which, as the name suggests, is run right after installing Linux on a computer.
This script:	-	adds apt lines to /etc/sources.list,
				-	adds ppa's incl keys,
				-	does an apt update/upgrade/auto-remove/clean cycle,
				-	installs extra packages and software,
				-	generates maintenance script and adds this to cron(server) or anacron(workstation)
				-	in case of a lxc host generates a container maintenance script as well

More information can be found after the news updates.

			past 2+ days, remove 30+ days old logs

	After running the Post Install script and after each run of the maintenance scripts, an email containing
	the logs is automatically sent to the given address(es) using the given credentials.
