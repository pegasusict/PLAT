# PLAT << Core edition >>
Pegasus' Linux Administration Tools is a set of bash scripts that make life easier for the Admin/new user on Ubuntu Server/Desktop derivatives.
It's main purpose is to help with bootstrapping systems and tedious repetitive tasks which make up a large portion of Linux administration.
This version consists of "core" functionality only - no debugging, commandline arguments, help text or ini parsing. Different scripts are used for different scenarios. As development progresses, structure and documentation will become self explanatory.
